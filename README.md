# SecondSoul : EcoFinds - Sustainable Second-Hand Marketplace
Every product gets a second soul, a newÂ journey.
SecondSoul is a web-based marketplace where users can buy and sell pre-loved items in a sustainable way.
This prototype focuses on user authentication, product listings, and a cart system to provide a sustainable approach to waste.
